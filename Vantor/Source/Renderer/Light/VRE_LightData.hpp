     * attenuation = 1.0 / (constant + linear * distance + quadratic * distanceÂ²)
     *

     * for uniform buffer objects, ensuring proper alignment and padding.
     * 
     * The ambient, diffuse, and specular arrays are sized to [3] to match
     * GLSL vec3 alignment requirements in uniform buffers.
